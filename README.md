# Blog-Application
I developed a modern and responsive blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The application is built using a full-stack approach, leveraging React.js and Material-UI for the frontend user interface, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. The data is managed in a MongoDB database.
